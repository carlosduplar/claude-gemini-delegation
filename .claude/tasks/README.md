# Task Execution Outputs

This directory stores input/output files for CLI delegations.

## Naming Convention

- `[taskid]_input.md` - Context file sent to CLI
- `[taskid]_result.md` - Output received from CLI
- `[taskid]_validation.md` - Validation gate results (if issues found)

## Cleanup Policy

Files older than 7 days may be archived or deleted to save space.
