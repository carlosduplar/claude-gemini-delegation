### Notes

All tests passed successfully, validating:
- Git operations delegate to Gemini Flash
- Multi-file operations delegate to Gemini Flash
- Security audits delegate to Gemini Pro
- Web search delegates to Gemini Flash
- Simple code generation handled directly by Claude (no delegation)
- Mixed tasks handled appropriately (delegate git, handle code generation)

The simplified KISS approach with 4 delegation rules proves effective.
